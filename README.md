# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework

* First I created all 3 html and labeled accordingly as About, Portfolio and Contact. I also created 3 different stylesheets so it's easy for me
to track the styling changes I made per html page. 

* I then created my navbar using a flexbox container from Bootstrap.  I used the .flex-row-reverse container for links to Portfolio, Contact and About page. I applied this code on the navbar for all three html pages for consistency. 

* Other styling applications used include social media icons from W3 school and Google Fonts

Index.html

* For this page, I created a main div class for my photo and bio. I used a card container from Bootstrap to contain my photo and bio. I adjusted the column sizes to create a responsive layout. 

* I created a "hero" div class to change some of the styling aspects of the main content in my own CSS stylesheet. 

* For links to my social media sites, I created a section div class and used a Bootstrap flex box with containers having justified-content utilities. 

* Lastly, I created a footer to complete the page. 

Contact.html

* For this page I applied the same styling for the navbar and footer as the index page for consistency. 

* I used a Bootstrap container with a div class of "row-justify-md-center" so my contact form is centered within this row container. 

* I used a Bootstrap form for the contact box and modified the size and default text content to match how I want my contact box to look. 

* I applied the same background image used in the index hero page to the row class for a consistent look.

* I added the same footer as the index page. 

Portfolio.html

* For this page, the same style for navbar and footer as the other two pages were applied.

* I used a Bootstrap container with a div class of "row-justify-md-center" and added a card in the middle to hold one of the webpages I created. I linked the image and text of the Roblox Fanpage so it takes the user to the Fanpage site.
